# Installation

Our *adapter-transformers* package is a drop-in replacement for Huggingface's *transformers* library. As the original package, it is tested on Python 3.6+ and PyTorch 1.1.0+. You will have to [install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) first. 

## Using pip (from GitHub)

The simplest way of installation is by using pip to install the package from our GitHub repository:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapter-transformers.git
```

## From repository

Alternatively, you can clone the repository first and install the package from source.
This allows you to run the included example scripts:

```
git clone https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapter-transformers.git
cd adapter-transformers
pip install .
```
